See all the characters? In my head it should have been double the amount.
But here's the thing; since I let them walk around super randomly, they very
often overlap eachother. The order of the drawn size is ofcourse decided in 
which order your write the draw function. 
For them to actually switch the position, I have to get the sprites y.position
and compare it to the other sprites y position. With this information I should
either push the draw function of the sprite back or forward. 
In theory this sounds super easy. I wouldn't say it necessarily is..
But where's the time?
