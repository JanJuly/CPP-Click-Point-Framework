Sarah: 
Let me just be honest. Due to other tasks, that I wanted to
accomplish, I didn't really find much time to work on this semester assignment.
Yes, I know that this is very important, and actually I had a lot of fun doing it
(especially learning c++), but still I had to set other priorities..
This resulted that I just started in the mid of march (please don't blame me)
and therefore had to work intensively on this task each day. Yes, it just took
me about 2.5 weeks to "finish" this.
