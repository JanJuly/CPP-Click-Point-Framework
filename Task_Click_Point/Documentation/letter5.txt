Sarah:
What I'm also super proud of is the text letter animation.
Why? Since I'm used to working with unity or other engines, stuff like this
was very quick and easy to implement.
But actually, having to code every single thing, shows you that there is much
more behind it.
The same with changing the scenes and drawing their specific textures.
